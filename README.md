# BackUp
Create a encrypted backup with a fast update mode.
<br>
The update mode only copies new and changed files.
<h2>Speed Copy</h2>
- My program: 12.9s for 3.1GB<br>
- Windows:    24.5s for 3.1GB
<h2>Speed encryption</h2>
- My program: 12.5s for 3.1GB<br>
- win rar:    1min 17.7s for 3.1GB
<br>
But the speed has its price. I don't use any key expansion or compression algorithms.
But for me is speed more important because a backup is something
you store on a external HDD on a save place.
Secret data should be encrypted stored all the time.
So it would make no sence to use a super secure encryption.

<h1><u>How to use</u></h1>
These are the back-up options.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p1.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
You can choose the target path with a file cooser or copy the path into it.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p2.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p3.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
Set a password.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p4.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
The missing data will now be determined.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p5.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
The last thing to do is to create the backup. Then the window closes.
