# BackUp
Create a encrypted backup with a update mode.
<br>
The update mode only copies new and changed files.
<br>
<h1><u>How to use</u></h1>
These are the back-up options.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p1.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
You can choose the target path with a file cooser or copy the path into it.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p2.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p3.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
Set a password.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p4.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
The missing data will now be determined.
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/p5.png" alt="Sample image could not be loaded."/></p><br>
The last thing to do is to create the backup. Then the window closes.
